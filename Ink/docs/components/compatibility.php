<h1 id="compatibility" class="light">Supported Clients</h1>
<p class="lead">We test and support all the major email clients &hellip; even Outlook.</p>
<hr />
<p>We support as many email clients and as much of the market as possible, however, we simply can't test for everything. As a result, we've decided to test the following clients, based on a combination of their <a href="http://emailclientmarketshare.com/">market share</a> and our ability to reliably test them with the devices and software we have access to.</p>
<p>While we will help out as much as possible with issues regarding other clients (and are more than willing to accept <a href="https://github.com/zurb/ink/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">pull requests</a> that add support for additional clients), we can't devote a lot of time or effort at this point to fixing issues related to email clients not in the following table.</p>
